Topic Modeling Using Top2Vec

I am using the top2vec algorithm, which is a variant of the word2vec algorithm that can be used for topic modeling. It learns vector representations of words (called "word embeddings") that capture the semantics of the words and the relationships between them. These word embeddings can then be used to identify the topics that occur in a collection of documents.

The first step in this process is to load and preprocess the documents. In this example, I am using a small collection of documents that are pre-defined in the code. You can replace these with your own documents by reading them in from a file or database.

I preprocess the documents by lowercasing all the words and removing stop words (common words that do not contribute much meaning, such as "the" and "a"). This results in a list of lists, where each inner list contains the preprocessed words in a single document.

Next, I train a top2vec model on the preprocessed documents. I initialize the model with several parameters that control the learning process:

size: The size of the word embeddings (the number of dimensions in the vector representation of each word). A larger size means that the model can capture more nuanced relationships between words, but it also requires more computational resources and may be more prone to overfitting.

window: The size of the context window used to learn the word embeddings. This is the number of words to the left and right of each word that are used to predict the current word. A larger window means that the model can capture more context, but it also requires more data and may be slower to train.

min_count: The minimum number of times a word must occur in the dataset to be included in the model. This can be used to exclude rare words that may not be meaningful.

workers: The number of worker threads to use for training. This can be used to parallelize the training process and speed up the learning.

Once the model is trained, I can use it to perform various tasks. For example, I can get the top-n most similar words to a given word using the most_similar method of the model's wv attribute. I can also get the vector representation of a word using the model's wv attribute, like this: vector = model.wv['word'].

Finally, I can perform dimensionality reduction on the word vectors to visualize them in 2D space. In this example, I am using t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) for this purpose. t-SNE is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that can preserve the local structure of the data.

To visualize the document vectors in 2D space, I use the TSNE class from scikit-learn to perform the dimensionality reduction, and then use matplotlib to plot the resulting points. The resulting plot shows the relationships between the documents in the dataset, and can give me a sense of the topics that are present in the dataset.
